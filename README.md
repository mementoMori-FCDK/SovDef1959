# SovDef1959

Research project for the faculty of arts (political studies) at the University of Manitoba.
The project illustrates the military production of Ukrainian regions (regional economic soviets) in 1959.
The goal is to draw the connection between the producers and the consumers of military equipment, high-end devices and machinery.

The interface consists of an interactive map, table and two overlays.

Implemented with leaflet js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, JQUERY.
